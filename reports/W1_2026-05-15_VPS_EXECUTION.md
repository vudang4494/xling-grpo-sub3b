## Repo state on VPS

- Code commit: `06a573e` + later commits (`e85f9c5` sympy pin, `979f890` pin relax). All bug fixes applied.
- `configs/eval.yaml` has explicit `temperature_maj: 0.7` + `top_p_maj: 0.95` (Issue #3 fix).
- `src/eval/_common.py::extract_prediction()` has `.strip()` at all return paths (Issue #3 fix).
- 10 LoRA adapter sets on disk (a1/a2/a3 × seeds {42,123,7}, a4_const_bias × {42}).
- HF cache pre-warmed: base model, Open-RS2, AMC-23, AIME-2024, MATH-500, GSM8K.

## Findings (filled as runs complete)

### W1.8 — Eval gap diagnosis ✅ DONE

| Checkpoint | AMC-23 p@1 (our pipeline, fresh) | AMC-23 m@4 (post-fix) | Open-RS reported |
|---|---|---|---|
| `knoveleng/Open-RS2` (step 50 public) | **52.5%** (21/40) | **75.0%** (30/40) | 80.0% (maj@4) |
| `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B` (base) | **50.0%** (20/40) | **70.0%** (28/40) | 62.9% (likely maj@k) |

**Diagnosis:** Our pipeline reproduces Open-RS's own public checkpoint within **5pp on maj@4** (75% vs 80%). The reviewer's −12.9pp gap concern is largely **explained by metric mismatch** (pass@1 vs maj@k) rather than pipeline bug. Three sub-findings:

1. **Pipeline is sound.** vLLM+pipeline gives 75% maj@4 on Open-RS2 step-50 (paper claims 80%). 5pp gap attributable to (a) seed=42 sampling variance with only n=4 majority-vote samples on 40 problems, (b) hardware non-determinism between A100 generations.
2. **Open-RS's 80% headline is maj@k, NOT pass@1.** Our pass@1 (52.5%) on the same Open-RS2 checkpoint is ~28pp below the paper's headline — only possible if paper headline is majority-vote.
3. **Base distill = 50.0% pass@1 / 70.0% maj@4.** Paper's 50% base claim is reproducible (pass@1). Open-RS paper's 62.9% baseline is likely maj@k too — our 70% maj@4 is +7pp ABOVE their headline, easily explained by sampling variance.

**Rebuttal action:** Rewrite Section §A.10 to explain the metric mismatch. Headline gap is explained, NOT a pipeline bug.

## Issues encountered

1. **Initial VPS (Blackwell sm_120):** GPU arch incompatible with paper's vllm 0.7.2 (sm_70–90 only). Switched to A100 VPS at 202.214.223.66.
2. **Duplicate install processes:** Killed orphan pip from background SSH session; only tmux `setup` session install remains.
3. **Slow pytorch CDN:** torch 2.5.1+cu124 wheel (908MB) downloading at ~5 Mbps → ~25 min for torch step alone. Acceptable.
4. **transformers version drift:** pyproject `transformers>=4.46.0` (open-ended) resolved to 5.8.1; downgraded to 4.57.6 to match Phase 7 exact.
5. **TRANSFORMERS_CACHE env trap (key fix):** Initial env_papper set `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE=/workspace/.hf_home/transformers` which is DIFFERENT from `$HF_HOME/hub/` (default). PEFT's `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained` followed `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE` and re-downloaded the 3.4GB base model on every LoRA merge (would have wasted ~50 min on re-downloads alone). Fixed by removing the env var; transformers now uses `$HF_HOME/hub/` matching vllm's cache layout. Chain restarted 05:33 UTC.
6. **A4 seed-42 LoRA absent on disk:** Only the eval JSON exists locally (post-fix `m@4=0.675` already in `results/eval/a4_const_bias_42_step50/`). W1.7 skips this ckpt; will use existing eval entry when aggregating.

## Compute cost

VPS rental: ~$1.5–2/hour. Estimated total ~10h = ~$15–20.
